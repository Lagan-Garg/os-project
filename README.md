# 🖥️ Operating Systems Mini Project - FCFS Scheduling Simulator

This project implements the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm using C.  
It is one of the simplest and most fundamental scheduling techniques in operating systems.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Simple, clean C implementation  
- Calculates:
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Accepts dynamic number of processes
- Beginner-friendly OS mini project

---

## 📌 How FCFS Works
- Processes are executed **in the order they arrive**  
- No preemption  
- Each process finishes before the next starts  
- Waiting time accumulates from previous burst times
